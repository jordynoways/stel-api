  title: STEL Order API Integration
  version: 1.0.0
  description: |
    This OpenAPI specification defines the endpoints used by the GPT agent
    to interact with the STEL Order service.  The API allows searching for
    work delivery orders (albaranes), retrieving detailed information, listing
    pending work delivery orders, uploading attachments and creating new work delivery orders.
    All requests must include an API key provided by STEL Order in the
    custom `APIKEY` header. The key must be sent as `APIKEY: <your-api-key>` without any prefix.

      # The STEL Order API expects the key to be sent in a custom header called
      # `APIKEY` without any prefix. Using another header name (e.g. Authorization)
      # will cause the server to reject the request as invalid. See the official
      # documentation at https://app.stelorder.com/app/indexapi.html for details.
      name: APIKEY
      description: |
        All requests must supply an API key in the `APIKEY` header without any
        prefix. For example, a request should send a header like:
        
        `APIKEY: 0RjnBmi37UswuylVpjIyi7I6gvX54i2ShBnJLsC0`
