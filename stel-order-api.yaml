    This OpenAPI specification defines the endpoints used by the GPT agent
    to interact with the STEL Order service.  The API allows searching for
    work orders (albaranes), retrieving detailed information, listing
    pending work orders, uploading attachments and creating new work orders.
    All requests must include an API key provided by STEL Order in the
    `Authorization` header using the format `ApiKey <your-api-key>`.
